Laptop Information Program

Description
This C++ program manages laptop information, allowing the user to store and display details about different laptops.

Features
-   Stores laptop attributes such as brand, model, serial number, color, price, processor speed, RAM, and screen size.
-   Utilizes a class to represent laptop objects.
-   Demonstrates the use of getters and setters to access and modify laptop information.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function, which demonstrates the creation of laptop objects, setting their attributes, and displaying the information.
-   `laptop.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Laptop class methods (constructor, getters, and setters).
-   `laptop.h`: Contains the declaration of the Laptop class.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling string data (laptop attributes).

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, laptop.cpp, laptop.h) and use a C++ compiler.
